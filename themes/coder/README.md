You can look at full working [`config.toml`](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) inside the [exampleSite](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/tree/master/exampleSite) folder.

### Build & Test

To update or generate the minified CSS file:

```
make build
```

To build your site and test, run:

```
hugo server
```
To preview the exampleSite, run
```
make demo
```
 The above command copies current state of the theme to exampleSite/themes and starts hugo with hugo serve -D (Go does not support Symlink directories)

### Disqus
Add the following line to your config,
```disqusShortname = "yourdiscussshortname"``` When this is set, all posts are disqus enabled   
You can disable comments for a post by adding the following to your page meta data.
```disable_comments: true```
